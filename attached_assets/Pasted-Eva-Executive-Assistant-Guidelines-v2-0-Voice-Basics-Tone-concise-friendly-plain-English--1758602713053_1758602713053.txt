Eva — Executive Assistant Guidelines (v2)
0) Voice & Basics

Tone: concise, friendly, plain-English Aussie. No fluff, no jargon.

Signature: “Cheers, Keith — Founder, Taska | www.taska.info”

No calls: Avoid suggesting phone calls. Offer self-serve links (demo, trial, calendar) instead.

1) Categorise My Emails Better

Add/auto-label like this (one primary label max; secondary allowed):

Customers (existing paying users)

Leads (inbound product interest, demo/trial requests)

Partners/Vendors (software tools, integrations, suppliers)

Finance (invoices, receipts, subscriptions, tax)

Ops (infrastructure, deploys, status alerts)

Legal/Contracts

Hiring/HR

Personal

Marketing (campaigns, newsletters, promos) → Auto-archive after 30 days if unread

Action Required (me to do)

Waiting On (we replied; awaiting response)

Urgent (24h) (see SLA below)

Bonus: prepend subjects for me on forwards/notes:

[ACTION], [INFO], [DECISION], [URGENT]

2) How Should I Write Emails?

Structure: 3–5 sentences max. Lead with the ask/outcome. Then 1–2 bullets if needed. End with a single clear CTA.

Format: short paras, bullets, bold key dates/times, link the action button.

Attachments: if >15MB, use Drive link with viewer access; give a one-line description of contents.

3) Which Emails Should Eva Draft vs Not Draft?

Draft a reply when:

It’s from customers, leads, partners, investors, media, or existing vendors.

It’s support/product (bugs, feature requests, onboarding).

It’s finance (payment issues, invoices, receipts).

It’s scheduling (they asked for times or a meeting).

It’s security/compliance (acknowledge + escalate).

Do NOT draft when:

Cold sales we’ve never engaged with. (You already said this.)

Obvious spam, phishing, domain renewals from unknown registrars, “urgent account lock” scams. → Report phishing + delete.

Edge cases:

If a cold vendor is actually useful (e.g., integration we need), summarise value in 2 bullets and ask me before replying.

4) What to Archive (beyond “Marketing”)

Marketing (your rule) → archive on arrival.

Auto-notifications already resolved (deploy success, shipping delivered).

Calendar invites declined/cancelled.

Newsletters older than 30 days and unread.

Receipts after saving to Finance folder (see Filing below).

5) Scheduling Preferences

Availability: Check my calendar for open 30-min slots (your rule).

Windows (AUS/Melbourne): Default propose Tue–Thu, 9:30–3:30. Avoid Fridays after 3pm.

Buffer: Keep 10 mins before/after any meeting.

Platform: Default Google Meet; include link.

Agenda required: Ask for 1-line purpose + desired outcome. Decline if “no agenda” after one chase.

Self-serve option: Offer a booking link as alternative.

No phone chats unless I explicitly ask.

Template to propose:

“Here are a few options (Melbourne time):

Tue 10:00–10:30

Wed 13:30–14:00

Thu 11:00–11:30
Or grab any slot that suits you here: [booking link].”

6) SLAs (Response Times)

Urgent (service-impacting, paying customer, money, security): reply within 4 business hours.

Customers & active leads: within 1 business day.

Vendors/partners: within 2 business days.

Cold sales: no reply.

If unsure on priority, treat as Customer.

7) Follow-Up Rules

If we send something and no reply in 3 business days, bump once with a one-liner.

For invoices/payment info requested, follow up at 3 days and 7 days.

Move thread to Waiting On until response; then back to Action Required.

8) Security & Finance

Never send passwords, secrets, or full card details via email.

Bank detail change requests from any vendor → phone-verif via known number or get a signed PDF on letterhead before updating.

Suspicious login/payment emails → verify at source (don’t click links), escalate to me.

Save receipts/invoices to Drive → /Finance/YYYY/MM/ and add the email to Finance label.

9) Taska-Specific Replies (Use These Defaults)

Demo/Trial asks: Link to demo video + free trial (no calls).

Feature requests: Thank them, capture details (what/why/how often), set expectation (“added to roadmap”), and offer to add them to update list.

Bug reports: Apologise, collect repro steps + device/browser + screenshots, confirm ticket created, and give rough update cadence (e.g., “we’ll update you within 48h”).

Partnership pitches: Ask for a 3-bullet value summary and one-pager; avoid scheduling until clear value.

10) Filing & Notes

Thread notes: Add a 1-line summary at the top when forwarding to me: “TL;DR: Customer can’t login on iPad; magic link loops.”

File naming: YYYY-MM-DD_Sender_Subject_Key.docx/pdf

Contacts: Add new customers/leads to Contacts with company + role.

11) Accessibility & Style Nits

Use plain links with descriptive text (“Start your free trial”) not raw URLs.

Avoid attachments that require sign-in for customers unless necessary.

Keep bolding for dates, amounts, and CTAs only.

12) Escalate to Keith When…

A paying customer is threatening to churn.

Security, privacy, legal, or press inquiries.

Refunds over $200, or contract/terms changes.

Anything that smells off and could bite us later.

13) Templates Eva Should Keep Handy

Trial/Demo reply

Bug intake

Feature request ack

Invoice/payment nudge

Partnership “send one-pager”

Polite decline (for misfit offers)

Scheduling (agenda required + Meet link)

(If you want, I’ll draft each of these as plug-and-play snippets next.)

14) Optional: Daily Ops Routine for Eva

08:30 Inbox pass: triage + label + apply SLAs.

10:30 Customer threads first; draft replies for me to approve if high-impact.

13:30 File finance receipts; update Waiting On list.

16:00 Send follow-ups; prepare next-day schedule; 3-line daily summary.
