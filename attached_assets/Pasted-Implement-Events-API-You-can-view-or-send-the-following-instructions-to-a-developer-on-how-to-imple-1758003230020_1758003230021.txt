1. Generate access token
An access token gives you access to Events API. Each time you make a call, you're required to use your access token.
After a token is generated, make sure to copy it. For security, TikTok won't save the token.
Generate access token
2. Send events through the API
Now that you have a token, choose events you want to send from your server. We recommend choosing at least 3 events. You'll also need to make a request and set up your payload.
Make a POST request
To send new events, make a POST request to this API's endpoint from this path:/open_api/v1.3/event/track/
When you post to this edge, TikTok creates new server events.
3. Build a payload
View how your payload should be structured. You can also use Payload Helper to check if there's any issues by creating a sample payload for your events.
