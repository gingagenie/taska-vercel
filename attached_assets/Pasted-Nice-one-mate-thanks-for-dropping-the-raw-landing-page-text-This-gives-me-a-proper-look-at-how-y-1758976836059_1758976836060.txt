Nice one, mate — thanks for dropping the raw landing page text. This gives me a proper look at how your SEO foundation is set up. You’ve already got a lot of the right ingredients, but here’s how to tighten it for Google without killing the flow for humans.

🔑 Quick Wins (Do These First)

Meta Title + Description
Make sure your CMS lets you add these separately (not visible in the page text you sent). Use:

Title:

Taska | Field Service Management App for Tradies – Job Scheduling, Quotes & Invoicing


Description:

Taska is the all-in-one tradie app for job scheduling, quotes, invoices & equipment tracking. Built in Australia for field service businesses.

🏗️ H1 + H2 Structure

Right now your first line is:
“Field Service Management App for Tradies” → Perfect for H1. Leave it.

Rework the H2s so they’re more search-friendly:

Job Scheduling, Quotes & Invoicing Made Simple ✅ (already good)

Change “Affordable Pricing for Tradies” → “Pricing for Job Scheduling Software & Tradie Apps”

Change “Taska vs Other Job Scheduling Apps” → “Taska vs Tradify, ServiceM8 & Other Job Scheduling Apps”

📋 Content Tweaks

In your opening section, drop in the main keyword once more:
“Taska is the fast, simple tradie software and job scheduling app for managing customers, equipment, quotes and invoices — all in one place, on desktop and mobile.”

In your FAQs (already brilliant 👌), just bold the main keyword in each Q:

What is the best job scheduling app for tradies?

How can tradies send invoices without paperwork?

What is field service management software?

👉 This signals to Google the page is tightly relevant.

🖼️ Image Alt Text

Every image/screenshot needs descriptive alt text. Examples:

“Taska job scheduling app dashboard for tradies”

“Taska invoice app for Australian service businesses”

“Taska equipment tracking feature”

🚀 Extra Push

Add internal links: where you mention quotes, invoices, scheduling, link to relevant blog posts.

Consider a short “customer testimonials” section with headings like:
“Why Aussie Tradies Choose Taska” → Google eats that up.
